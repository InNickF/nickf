description: "
  Marketing Product Fit is a concept that emphasizes the importance of aligning a product's features and benefits with the needs and preferences of its target market. It involves understanding the target audience, their pain points, and how the product can effectively address those needs. I worked side by side with Manuel Villegas (Yes Sir's CEO) to build a branding around this concept and start helping companies to achieve this goal."
