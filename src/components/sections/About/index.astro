    Design, Code & a Bit of Me
  </h4>
  <p class="lg:max-w-3/4">
    Product Designer & Full-Stack Developer with over 8 years of experience
    creating innovative digital products, libraries, and web applications from
    the ground up. I believe technology goes beyond tools—it's a creative
    language capable of generating emotion, connection, and transformation.
    Self-taught and endlessly curious, I often explore disciplines beyond
    coding—such as visual design, creative coding, and generative arts—always
    seeking deeper meaning and impactful experiences. My core principle: combine
    strategy, creativity, science, and code to build products that resonate and
    leave a lasting impression.
